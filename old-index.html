                        I have always been drawn to the outdoors and was finally introduced to birding, my lifelong passion,through the Wildlife Ecology and Conservation program at UMass. Since learning about the 900+ birds that can be found in North America throughout the year, I have birded in 15 states and 4 countries, soon to make it 5. My favorite birding experiences were in Bend, Oregon, where the local water treatment facility treated me to over 140 species of birds.

                                Working in the coastal rainforest of Northern Oregon and waking up at 3AM to do so was hard but rewarding work. A typical day involved waking up, driving on unimproved roads as close to the survey as I could get, then using GPS to navigate while I was trekking up and down steep slopes in the dark to get to the survey point 45 minutes before dawn, and remain at the survey for 75 minutes after dawn.

                                This was my second season (the first was in 2015) and I was in charge of three other individuals, scheduling their surveys and breaking up their workload for setting stations. I was also in charge of entering and maintaining survey data and communicating survey progress with our State contact.

                                I am passionate about using technology to advance the field of Wildlife Biology. There is so much data from the past and the present that could be analyzed to help us deepen our understanding of our country's natural history, and I would love to build the tools necessary to get through that backlog.

                            I am interested in utilizing data science to help clean and analyze data in the Wildlife Biology field. There is a huge amount of raster data that could potentially be analyzed using machine learning techniques, such as categorizing infrared values from satellites to measure vegetation cover by identifying plant or tree types.

                            I am using my Python and Web Development skills to brainstorm and build apps to help with data collection, cleaning, access and presentation. I like programming in Python because of the simplicity of the language as well as the vast number of resources provided by the open source Python community.
