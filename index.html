                        Over the last 6 months I have been working hard on a hobby of mine that I am working to turn into a career. Programming has been so much fun for me to learn and practice over the last two years, and I've gotten serious about Android and Machine Learning with Python in the last few months. Both are fun to code and there is an overlap where both can be used to do great things in the world. I've also dipped my toes into web-developing with the barebones (HTML/CSS/JS), Django, ASP.NET, and Node.js. All of those were fun but I just kept going back to Android and Python!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not working on learning new things about programming, I've done my best to learn about the 900+ birds that can be found in North America. I have birded in 15 states and 5 countries. My favorite birding experiences were in Bend, Oregon, where the local water treatment facility treated me to over 140 species of birds (pun INTENDED).

                                Working in the coastal rainforest of Northern Oregon (and waking up at 3AM to do so) was hard but rewarding work. A typical day involved driving on unimproved roads as close to the survey as I could get, then using GPS to navigate while I was trekking up and down steep slopes in the dark to get to the survey point 45 minutes before dawn and remain at the survey for 75 minutes after dawn.

                                This was my second season (the first was in 2015) and I was in charge of three other individuals, scheduling their surveys and breaking up their workload for setting stations. I was also in charge of entering and maintaining survey data and communicating survey progress with our State contact.

                                I am passionate about using technology to advance the field of Wildlife Biology. There is so much data from the past and the present that could be analyzed to help us deepen our understanding of our country's natural history, and I would love to build the tools necessary to get through that backlog.

                            I've started down this path by becoming an MS candidate in Data Science at <a href="http://www.ccsu.edu/datamining/">CCSU</a>! Data science has so many applications in so many fields that it's hard to choose just one, but here is an idea off the top of my head: using machine learning and raster data to measure vegetation cover by identifying plant or tree types.
